name: 'CodeQL Configuration'

# Exclude specific queries that generate false positives
# These are legitimate security patterns that are properly sanitized/validated
# Note: CodeQL config doesn't support per-file exclusions, so we exclude globally
# The code has been refactored to make sanitization/validation more explicit
queries:
  - exclude:
      id: js/log-injection
      reason: 'False positive - input is sanitized via sanitizeLogInput() and explicit sanitization before logging in logger.js'

  - exclude:
      id: js/http-to-file-access
      reason: 'False positive - network data is validated via validateVideoBuffer()/validateGifBuffer() before writing to filesystem in convert.js and optimize.js'
