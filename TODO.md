## creating issue template for github

need to create issue templates in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` directory. should include templates for bug reports, feature requests, and possibly documentation updates. templates should guide users to provide relevant information like steps to reproduce, expected vs actual behavior, environment details, and version information.

## creating wiki for github

need to set up github wiki pages covering key topics like installation, configuration, usage examples, api documentation, troubleshooting common issues, and development setup. wiki should be comprehensive enough for users to understand how to use and contribute to gronka.

## make proper documentation thats up to date

current documentation needs review and updates. should ensure readme.md is accurate, setup instructions work, configuration options are documented, and any recent changes are reflected. may need to add missing documentation for features that were added but not documented.

## fix tool bar in logs (sucks bad)

the filter toolbar in `src/webui/Logs.svelte` has usability and layout issues. the filters section with component filters, level toggles, search, time range, and export buttons needs improvement. likely needs better responsive design, clearer organization, and possibly a collapsible or more compact layout to reduce clutter.
